ab + cd

(a, b, c, d, k) => *(a, b,
	ab => *(c, d,
		cd => +(ab, cd, k)
	)
)

(a, b, c, d, k) => +(?, ?, k)

(a, b, c, d, k) =>
	depend(ab = *(a, b, ab), cd = *(c, d, cd))
	+(ab, cd, k)

depend acts like... a promise, which helps to flatten the data flow
 dependencies which would otherwise have an order of evaluation
 built in rather than the ideal, making the dependencies explicitly
 parallel

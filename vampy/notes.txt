Design principles:
 * Sound design should let someone play blind
 * "Make your own difficulty" risk v reward
 * Skill is much more important than stats - a skilled player should be able to have fun no matter what stats they have
 * Punishments should be player-inflicted; dice rolls, even if the player chooses them, feel cheap
 * Isaac puzzle rooms are boring because they always have the same solution
Inspiration sources:
 * Binding of Isaac
 * OoT shadow temple

4 Main villains:
 * Mom & Dad
 * Depression/Self (either works)
 * Eldritch beasty

Evil Eye:
 * Static motif, symbolize mental breakdown/inability to think
Music has strong beat to sound like a heart? That always spooks me. Might be able to play with that to communicate info too
What layout variables do we have easy control of?
 * Branching and rejoining
Before map gen, we need enemy types as rooms should be designed around them
Enemy qualities:
 * Movement style: Sit, run, rush, pounce, pinch, zone, jump, stumble
   - Note: Pinch is the pacman style of AI design, where some enemies should move toward one unit ahead/behind the player rather than a simple A*
 * Attacks: Body, melee, range, AoE, cling, debuff, death, spawn
 * Defense: None, phased, shield, dodge, run, hologram
 * Death: Nothing, explode, shoot, spawn

Boss idea:
 * Sickly, lanky humanoid shoved into a tiny box, limbs clearly broken all over. To attack, it reaches out and swipes etc
 * Humanoid shaves flesh off its body to spawn enemies which can attack
I want thew game to feel endless, even though it has a defined end. Playing is fun, but playing with the end in mind should feel torturously laborous. Only by simply playing the game can you enjoy finishing it
Idea: You can fight an end-floor boss unless you either have enough enemies killed or you take half your health. Generally players should get this naturally, but it leaves it open for speedrunners
Should it be obvious where the bosses are? Signs etc?
It's nice to know exactly what your health is, but maybe health can be a float, maybe with the maximum hit being marked. Maybe there can be a kind of "max damage" stat which caps damage taken in one go (before -> after i frames). Not knowing exactly what your health is is unnervnig because it sh ows a lack of control/info
Is there such a thing as a proc gen metroidvania?
Boss doors lock behind you - even if you get out, you'll need to pay again to get back in
Hazard puzzle: walk in between cogs, dont' get crushed
Floor where the walls are stuffed with living people just watching
Ending - you put your eye in your heart?
Having fun should come at the expense of finishing

What once was is not, and what will ne'er was.

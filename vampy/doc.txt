I don't want a round to be longer than an hour. A few minutes even

Want to make this a game of simplified social exploration
Interesting idea: Make vampires and humans equally powerful, equally capable of transitioning. Let social roles dictate that vampires are the hunters, not the hunted

Players can be killed, but round winner is determined by the number of players in a contiguous base

Players lose points every time they transition

Milk cures vampirism

Changing takes a bit. Milk stops vampirism, blood stops humanism.

Players can carry one thing at a time, forcing cooperation

Vampirism cured by getting holy water?

Vampires become human in daylight?
* Daylight + holy sigil
* Daylight also hurts

Humans can't see in the dark so well

How to determine friend or foe?
* Vampires will, naturally, be able to bite humans

Can hold, one visible and one hidden:
* Pick-Axe (2 stone, 1 wood)
* Holy sigil (2 wood, 2 stone, 4 milk)
* Torch (2 wood)
* Rope (4 wood)

* Milk (pet a cow)
* Blood (hurt a player)
* Wood (mine a tree)
* Stone (mine a rock)

* wall (4 stone)
* floor (4 wood)
* door (2 wood, 2 stone)
* bridge (2 wood, 2 stone)

* Tree
* Rock
* Water
* Grass

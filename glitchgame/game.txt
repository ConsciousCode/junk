Isaac + DKII
 * It'd be cool if the minmaxing was made complicated enough that the correct
    solution is never immediately obvious
 * Also unlike Isaac, work to increase the fun factor rather than just raw
    random difficulty
 * Terrain destruction made a core part of the gameplay?
   - Might be good to have more AoE

Themes
 * Depression
 * Lack of motivation despite ambition
 * Catastrophic thinking
 * Seeing the cruelty of others
 * Villain is like the heart-room guy from Courage, trying to stop the player
   - Obv representation of depression and cynicism
   - Alt villain is hopelessness
 * The deeper you go, the more death symbolism
 * Rooms are small life events, bosses are people you care about
 * Health is willpower
 * Tears are bullets
 * Pills are passive items you can lose
 * Each level is an extra layer of abstraction
 * The game is the internal state of the player representing outside
 * Willpower, speed, damage, tears
   - Willpower is resistance to health change
   - Speed is char speed representing franticness
   - Damage represents your ability to argue against depression
   - Tears is sadness
 * Literal transformations
 * Keys are "ideas", money = health
 * Friends and pets act like meatshields

Broken world
Detached player character
Problems caused by glitches
NOT aiming to "fix" the game!!
Main plotline is a corrupted version of what the "real" game would have

Meta-character, "the dev", abstraction of my intent as the game's designer, where the game is presented as being made by that character

Main city is above ground, nearly devoid of glitches
 * Populus shuns anything from the underground
 * Population knows on some level they're living a facade

Deeper you go underground, the more glitchy and unfinished things get

In-game lore:
 * Robots named Archons build the world - archons are a representation of dev's creation of the world
   - To build more on the gnosticism symbolism, archons were created by the main antagonist named "1/2 urge" (demiurge), or in-game "Urge" and it's made clear that it's half of what it's supposed to be
 * Archons are called R-Cons, short for "Reality Constructor/Controller/Converter/Confiner"

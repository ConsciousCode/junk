How can officials/companies be rewarded for good behavior?

Company utility = $$$
Human utility = social recognition

Companies are made of humans, so human utility plays a secondary role in their utility

We can't control $$$, but we can control social recognition

Types of social recognition:
* Inclusion - group you belong to is recognized
* Direct - you are applauded directly

Social recognition is cheap, but not free.
We also need proper marketing to give it value
Make it easy to share, easy to participate

Vote-based? Candidates have dedicated URLs/IDs for voting on their

"Social capital", have points which represent "goodness" which can be traded and donated as desired

Similar to Dogecoin, but more meaningful

Need to connect actions to social capital, right?

Upvotes and downvotes?

Should actions be self-reported? The danger there is that they could lie, or fail to report bad actions, overinflating their goodness

Currency should be called "cred"

Could have users provide a "reason" which reinforces as it's repeated

I know, credibility isn't a solitary value, but an aggregate of percentages of people's cred

Everyone has 1 cred guaranteed, which they can split up as they want between people they like
When you get cred associated with you, the cred you give to others increases proportionally
This results in hierarchies of cred which bunch together into the "most liked" people

Having distinct cred targets means the user has to constantly reevaluate who they're crediting to free up room for new targets

Pages:
* Homepage, allows searching and recent changes
* User page, lists a user's cred and outlets
* Cred page, credit a particular user with an optional message
* REST API
  - news.json
  - user.json
  - cred.json

URLS:
 * me
 * login logout
 * +(person-id)
 * search
 * api api/news.json api/user.json api/cred.json
 * about
 * donate
 * legal
 * contact
 
 Databases:
 * news [ id, headline, content, date ]
 * users [ id, name, total, avatar, description, email, password, salt, redirect? ]
 * creds [ id, by, for, amount, message, time ]

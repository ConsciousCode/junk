BoI flaws to fix:
 * Correct solutions lead to play minmaxing
 * Made worse by a general lack of choice, there's always one goal unless minmax
 * Items as the primary random element leads to synergies getting boring
 * Lack of overarching winstate reduces sense of satisfaction
 * Stats and items are poorly balanced and easily lead to rot or steamrolling,
    very rarely does it run the middle
 * Excessive item combos make item synergies extremely hard to program
 * Items have objective tiering, some items are essentially garbage while others
    are literally game-winning
 * Uses true randomness - optimizes fairness rather than fun (ideally
    randomness would be weighted towards having fun but not easy)
 * Prefab rooms have intentional design but become recognizable after enough time
 * Emphasis on speed for boss rush makes it hard to focus on enjoying yourself
 * Devil Deal's power and mechanically random nature leads to monologues like
    "Aaand... No devil deal! :O" where skill isn't necessarily rewarded and
    the items are treated as givens
 * Some strange design choices such as golden hearts, which add no strategic
    depth or the Lost/Keeper with difficulty for its own sake
 * Meta utility game-breaking items (rerolling in general, blank card, jera,
    sack boy/humbling bundle, any infinite loop, diplopia is the worst yet
    because its usage is so powerful that it's impossible to know when the
    best time to use it is)
 * In general, the game has too many rules and variables. This makes balancing
    and mechanical experimentation nearly impossible because there's too much
    to take into account
 * Getting a general MtG specialist vibe from NL

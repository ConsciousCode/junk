Logical size: The "actual" size of the component
Display size: The size of the view of the component, used to separate layout
 from logical size

min/max/explicit size affect display size

display <= logical
* If it would be the case that logical < display, logical is bounded to display

Planned classes:
* Containers
** Box - holds just one
** Span - displays children using line breaking and text layout semantics
** Row - displays children in a row
** Col - displays children in a column
** Pile - displays children on top of each other (spoofing CSS absolute)
* Content
** Text - formatted text
** Image - an image
**
